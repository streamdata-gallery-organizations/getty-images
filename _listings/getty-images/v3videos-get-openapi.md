  title: Getty Images Get Videos Metadatata
  description: "Use this endpoint to return detailed video metadata for all the specified
    video ids.\r\n\r\nYou'll need an API key and access token to use this resource.
    Please see our [Getting Started](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/getting-started.html)
    page for more information on how to sign up for an API key.\r\n\r\nYou can show
    different information in the response by specifying values on the \"fields\" parameter
    (see details below).\r\nYou can search with only an API key, and that will give
    you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com
    site without being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API
    customer and would like to ensure that your API searches return only assets that
    you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token in
    the header of your request.  Please consult our [Authorization FAQ](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html)
    for more information on authorization tokens, and our [Authorization Workflows](https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api/blob/master/OAuth2Workflow.md)
    for code examples of getting a token.\r\n\r\n## Working with Fields Sets\r\n\r\nFields
    sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata
    fields. The following fields sets are available:\r\n\r\n#### Summary Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe
    **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of
    metadata fields that are often used to build search response results. The following
    fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **summary_set**
    in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n
    \       \"caption\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n
    \       \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\":
    \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n
    \           },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n
    \       ],\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n####
    Detail Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields value
    represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed
    view of videos. The following fields are provided for every video in your result
    set when you include **detail_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":
    \r\n    [\r\n        \"allowed_use\",\r\n        \"artist\",\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n
    \       \"caption\",\r\n        \"clip_length\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n
    \       \"collection_id\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"color_type\",\r\n
    \       \"copyright\",\r\n        \"date_created\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n
    \       [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n
    \           {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n
    \               \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"download_sizes\",\r\n
    \       \"era\",\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"mastered_to\",\r\n
    \       \"originally_shot_on\",\r\n        \"product_types\",\r\n        \"shot_speed\",\r\n
    \       \"source\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Display
    Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents
    the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most
    frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields
    are provided for every video in your result set when you include **display_set**
    in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"display_sizes\":
    \r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n
    \           {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n
    \               \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##
    Request Usage Considerations\r\n\r\n- Specifying the \"entity_details\" response
    field can have significant performance implications. The field should be used
    only when necessary."

        fields. The following fields sets are available:\r\n\r\n#### Summary Fields
        Set\r\n\r\nThe **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents
        a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to \r\nbuild search response
        results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result
        set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n

        Detail Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields
        value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to \r\nbuild
        a detailed view of images. The following fields are provided for every image
        in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n

        Display Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **display_set** query string parameter fields

        sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata
        fields. The following fields sets are available:\r\n\r\n#### Summary Fields
        Set\r\n\r\nThe **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents
        a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search response
        results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result
        set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n
        \   \"videos\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n
        \       \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n
        \       [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n
        \           {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n
        \           {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n
        \       ],\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n####
        Detail Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields
        value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build
        a detailed view of videos. The following fields are provided for every video
        in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n
        \   \"videos\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"allowed_use\",\r\n        \"artist\",\r\n
        \       \"asset_family\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"clip_length\",\r\n
        \       \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_id\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n
        \       \"color_type\",\r\n        \"copyright\",\r\n        \"date_created\",\r\n
        \       \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\":
        \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n
        \           },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n
        \           }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"download_sizes\",\r\n        \"era\",\r\n
        \       \"license_model\",\r\n        \"mastered_to\",\r\n        \"originally_shot_on\",\r\n
        \       \"product_types\",\r\n        \"shot_speed\",\r\n        \"source\",\r\n
        \       \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Display Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe
        **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields
        that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most frequently
        used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided
        for every video in your result set when you include **display_set** in your
        request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"display_sizes\":
        \r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n
        \           {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n
        \           {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n
        \       ]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Request Usage Considerations\r\n\r\n-
        Specifying the \"entity_details\" response field can have significant performance
        implications. The field should be used only when necessary."
