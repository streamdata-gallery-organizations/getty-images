    with Fields Sets\r\n\r\nFields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter
    to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:\r\n\r\n####
    Summary Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **summary_set** query string parameter fields value
    represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build \r\nsearch
    response results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result
    set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"images\":\r\n

    \   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Detail Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **detail_set** query
    string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that
    are often used to build a \r\ndetailed view of images. The following fields are
    provided for every image in your result set when you include **detail_set** in
    your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"images\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"allowed_use\",\r\n

    \r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Display Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe
    **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that
    provide you with URLs for the low resolution\r\nfiles that are most frequently
    used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided
    for every image \r\nin your result set when you include **display_set** in your
    request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"images\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"display_sizes\":

    Request Usage Considerations\r\n\r\n- Specifying the \"entity_details\" response
    field can have significant performance implications. The field should be used
    only when necessary."

    must be uploaded to a specific AWS S3 bucket. The bucket name is `search-by-image.s3.amazonaws.com`.\r\nFor

    -H \"Content-Type: image/jpeg\" --data-binary \"@testimage.jpg\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUploads
    can be overwritten if the names are the same, so using a prefix like the API Key,
    application name or company name would help keep that\r\nfrom happening.\r\n\r\nOnce
    the image has been uploaded, use the full URL in the `image_url` parameter, e.g.
    `image_url=https://search-by-image.s3.amazonaws.com/my-test-image.jpg`.\r\n\r\nSubsequent
